* Glopad to RDF
The glopad data was provided as a dump of a postgres database. This
was loaded into a postgres 9.3 database and then mapped to RDF using
D2RQ.

** To generate mappings and deploy to tomcat

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

$ cd d2rq
$ ./glopad-table-analysis.pl yourdbuser dbpassword
# result is placed in webapp/WEB-INF/mapping.ttl
$ ant war
$ cp d2rq.war /lib-dev/tomcat/webapps

#+END_SRC

** To dump glopad as N3 RDF

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

$ cd d2rq
$ ./glopad-table-analysis.pl bdc34 xyz
# result is placed in webapp/WEB-INF/mapping.ttl
$ ./dump-rdf -b http://bdc34-dev.library.cornell.edu:8080/GloPAD/ webapp/WEB-INF/mapping.ttl > glopad-dump.n3

#+END_SRC

** To generate an ontology for the RDF
The glopad-dump.n3 doesn't have classes and properties defined.
Pellet can generate them. See:
http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/icv/

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

$ cd ~/pellet
$ ./pellet.sh lint -v -only RDF -f /lib-dev/vitro-glopad/lopad-ont.rdf ~/glopadRdf/glopad-dump.n3 > /lib-dev/vitro-glopad/glopadLint.out

#+END_SRC

* Visualization of GlopadRDF
